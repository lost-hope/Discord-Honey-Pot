# Discord-Honey-Pot 🍯

A Discord.js bot that acts as a honeypot to automatically detect and ban spam bots. The bot monitors a designated "honeypot" channel and instantly bans any user who posts in it, as legitimate users should never interact with this hidden channel.

## Purpose 🎯

This bot helps server administrators combat spam bots by:
- Creating a trap channel that legitimate users won't access
- Automatically banning any user who posts in the honeypot channel
- Logging all ban actions for review and analysis
- Cleaning up spam messages from the past 7 days

## How It Works ⚙️

1. The bot monitors a specific channel designated as the honeypot
2. When any user sends a message in that channel, they are immediately banned
3. The ban action, user information, message content, and server name are logged to `log.txt`
4. Messages from the banned user in the past 7 days are automatically deleted

## Prerequisites 📋

- Node.js (v16.9.0 or higher)
- A Discord Bot account with the following permissions:
  - Ban Members
  - Read Messages/View Channels
  - Read Message History
- Bot intents enabled in Discord Developer Portal:
  - Server Members Intent
  - Message Content Intent

## Installation 🚀

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Discord-Honey-Pot.git
cd Discord-Honey-Pot
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a configuration file:
```bash
cp config.json.example config.json
```

4. Edit `config.json` with your bot credentials:
```json
{
    "token": "your-bot-token-here",
    "channelID": "honeypot-channel-id",
    "serverid": "your-server-id"
}
```

## Configuration ⚙️

Edit the [config.json](config.json) file with the following values:

- `token`: Your Discord bot token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- `channelID`: The ID of the channel you want to use as a honeypot (right-click channel → Copy ID)
- `serverid`: Your Discord server ID (right-click server → Copy ID)

**Important:** Make sure the honeypot channel is accessible to everyone, but add a message explaining the purpose of that channel before turning on the bot.

## Usage 💻

1. Start the bot:
```bash
node index.js
```

2. When the bot is ready, you'll see:
```
Ready! Logged in as YourBotName#1234
```

3. The bot will now monitor the specified channel and automatically ban users who post in it.

## Logging 📝

All ban actions are logged to `log.txt` in the root directory with the following information:
- Banned user's tag
- Message content that triggered the ban
- Server name

## Security Best Practices 🔒

- **Never commit** your `config.json` file (it's already in [.gitignore](.gitignore))
- Keep your bot token secret
- Regularly review the `log.txt` file for false positives
- Set appropriate channel permissions so legitimate users cannot see the honeypot channel
- Consider using role-based restrictions to hide the channel from new members

## Troubleshooting 🔧

**Bot doesn't ban users:**
- Verify the bot has "Ban Members" permission
- Ensure the bot's role is higher than the roles of users you want to ban
- Check that `channelID` and `serverid` in [config.json](config.json) are correct

**"Missing Permissions" error:**
- Make sure the bot has Administrator permission or at least Ban Members permission
- Verify the bot's role hierarchy

**Bot doesn't respond:**
- Check that Message Content Intent is enabled in the Discord Developer Portal
- Verify your token is correct in [config.json](config.json)
